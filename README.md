Paper Title

An Empirical Study on Software Developer-Related Factors and Technical Debt in Open-Source Software Projects

Abstract

Technical debt reflects hidden issues in software that arise from software developers’ activities and remains a long-standing concern in software maintenance. While existing research has primarily focused on identifying and managing technical debt, less attention has been given to the influence of developer-related factors. This study investigates the relationships between developer activeness and developer experience and the accumulation of technical debt, measured through technical debt density in open-source software projects.

Using proposed metrics—including active contributors, developer experience, technical debt density, and technical debt management performance—we conducted a statistical analysis across 116 Python open-source repositories. The results reveal no evidence that the proportion of active contributors influences technical debt density. However, levels of developer experience are associated with the improvement of technical debt management performance. Specifically, highly experienced developers show less improvement compared to those with lower experience levels. Additional influences such as project status, developers’ perception of technical debt, and project practices may also contribute to the presence of technical debt in project code.
